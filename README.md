# Covid-19-Detection-using-Radiography-Dataset

I have tried a Deep Learning project to detect covid-19 from radiography dataset made by Kaggle. I have used VGG 16 algorithm. After the 50 epochs, I have got 96% in both Training and Cross Validation Accuracy. The Project was conducted in Kaggle Notebook. Thank You.
